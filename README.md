# PORTFOLIO
This repo lists all projects with a short description

- **Circuit Design Visualizer**

It Minimizes Boolean functions for small combinational circuits using the Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm. Detects special circuits like adders, subtractors, flip-flops, multiplexers, decoders, and registers. Supports Q-M minimization for small combinational circuits and state diagrams for sequential circuits. Generates PDF visualizations for Combinational circuits (hazard-free and simplified versions using Schemdraw) and Sequential circuits (next-state and output logic diagrams)

Note: Sequential circuit state diagram visualization is currently not implemented.

- **Graph Analyzer**

Can handle graph analysis and visualization. It allows the user to input a graph (either manually or via CSV file) and perform various analyses such as checking connectivity, detecting cycles, finding shortest paths, computing node degrees, performing topological sorting, and visualizing directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted graphs.

- **Spanning Tree Optimization**e

Demonstrates the computation and visualization of several spanning tree optimizations from a weighted undirected graph loaded from an adjacency matrix using Kruskals Algorithm, Disjoint Set Union (DSU), Edge Replacement Strategy, NetworkX + Matplotlib.
